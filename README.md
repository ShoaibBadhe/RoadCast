Task given by Roadcast Tech. Solutions Pvt. Ltd

Create a simple python flask application with 2 endpoints '/PostgreSQL' and '/MySQL'. The application must use SQLAlchemy to fetch data from tables of your choice. The '/PostgreSQL' endpoint must return data from PostgreSQL database while '/MySQL' must return data from MySQL database within the single application.

I have added photos of output and used phpmyadmin and phppgadmin for mysql and postgresql respectively.

Note . Create a folder 'templates'and move html files in that folder as shown in the image attached to get output.
